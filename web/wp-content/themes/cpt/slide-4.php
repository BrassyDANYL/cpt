         <h4>RAT: jail case management, planning, and supervision</h4>
         <p>
         In jails, RATs are used to supplement case management, a process intended to reduce risk by ensuring individuals have
         access to needed resources. Case management refers to the process in which officials evaluate incarcerated peoples’
         needs and risks, and connect them to appropriate services and programs. Intended to provide continuity of care between
         incarceration and the community, case management considers factors related to physical and mental health, substance
         abuse, education, housing, and employment.</p>
         <p>
         In this context RATs serve to automate the evaluation and resource recommendation functions. They’re used to funnel
         scarce resources—attention and programming from case managers—towards the supposedly highest risk individuals. These
         tools are not only diagnostic but distributive as well; they are meant to provide case managers with recommendations
         about how to best reduce individuals’ risks based on their evaluated needs.</p>

         <h4>Basics</h4>
         <p>“Crime forecasting” refers to two separate but related processes: predictive policing and data-driven prosecution. Both
         processes use historical crime data to make predictions about future crime, using these predictions to inform who is
         policed and prosecuted. Based on existing “hot spot” theories of policing, crime forecasting assumes there are
         particular areas and individuals who are more “at-risk” for criminal activity. Automated tools analyze data such as
         where past crimes occurred and features of the local environment to determine if a location is “at-risk,” or if an
         individual is “likely” to commit or be the victim of a crime. Law enforcement sees these tools as more efficient and
         less biased than humans, capable of making quick decisions while also cutting costs.</p>

         <h3>Face recognition</h3>
         <span class="orange-line"></span>
         <p>Unbeknownst to you, the police officer had previously run the photo of a suspect in a shoplifting case through a face
         recognition system. You were returned as a match for the suspect, which formed the basis of the warrant for your arrest.</p>

         <h4>Basics</h4>
         <p>
         Face recognition technology, (often called “facial” recognition), is an algorithmic biometric tool that which compares
         two face images to determine the likelihood they are a match. Law enforcement purportedly uses face recognition to
         produce leads when trying to identify people in photos or video footage. There are generally two types of face
         recognition: one-to-one matching, which compares two photos to one another to verify they’re the same person; and
         one-to-many matching, which compares one photo to a large database in order to identify someone. In the latter, officers
         upload a “probe” photo of a face in question, and an algorithm analyzes its features, compares it to a database of face
         photos, and then issues a numerical score reflecting the similarity of the “probe” photo face to other faces in the
         database.</p>
         <p>
         When analyzing a photo, the algorithm first detects the presence of a face. Then, it “normalizes” the image, scaling and
         rotating so it’s in a standard position for comparison. Next, it extracts facial features like eyes and nose from the
         image. Finally, it compares these features to those in another photo, assigning a score based on how similar they are.
         Face recognition refers to this specific process, as distinct from other face analysis tools that purport to classify
         people’s faces by factors like gender or age.</p>
