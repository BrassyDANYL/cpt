         <h4>Risk assessment tools (RATs)</h4>
         <p>
         Risk assessment tools (RATs) are a general class of algorithms that purport to predict the likelihood of an individual
         engaging in certain unwanted behavior in the future. Most commonly in the criminal legal system, they are used to
         forecast future misconduct; specifically, the chance an individual will skip bail, commit another crime, or be
         rearrested. They are also used to anticipate challenges incarcerated people will have during transitions into and out of
         institutionalization.</p>
         <p>
         With “risk” in mind, criminal legal system officials make decisions about peoples’ liberty, supervision, and
         criminogenic needs. There are six main stages at which RATs are employed: pretrial, jail, prison, release, parole, and
         probation. Most notably, RATs are used for setting bail, case management in jails, sentencing, case management in
         prisons, informing discretionary release/parole, case management during parole, and determining probation. However, they
         can theoretically be used at any point during an individual’s interaction with the criminal legal system.</p>

         <h4>Risk assessment tools (RATs)</h4>
         <p>
         A defendant often has their first encounter with an RAT before trial when their bail is being set. Here, RATs are used
         in one of two ways: to gauge the likelihood of an individual’s failure to appear (FTA) at their trial, or to assess
         their likelihood of committing another crime before trial. Historically, bail was used exclusively as a means to ensure
         court appearances and discourage flight. However, due to a number of political shifts, the concept of an individual’s
         “dangerousness” to the community became a major factor in bail determination. RATs, when used to set bail, now score
         people based on their FTA likelihood and risk of committing a crime after pretrial release.</p>
         <p>
         Initially, some critics of mass incarceration supported this application of RATs as a way to decrease pretrial detention
         rates and eliminate the disadvantage poor people face with cash bail. But these tools led to only small increases in
         pretrial release, and, in fact, increased FTAs and pretrial crime rates. Moreover, they yet again exhibit the
         limitations of data-driven technologies: because RATs are trained on specific data, they fail to reflect the true
         complex realities of the criminal legal system. Across place and time, RATs apply a one-size-fits-all approach to
         different contexts not necessarily compatible with the originally collected data. For example, RATs are often trained on
         older data; but if a jurisdiction has since instituted pretrial reforms, the RAT will reflect outdated practices rather
         than current ones. If a new diversion program is introduced to decrease pretrial detention and recidivism, the RAT does
         not take this into account, hiding any potential effects the reform has and reinforcing historical trends.
