However, they can theoretically be used at any point during an individual’s interaction with the criminal legal system.\r\n\r\nFor more on the basics of risk assessment tools, see:'),(145,59,'_more_info_for_pop-up_1','field_62b5709e7557c'),(146,59,'title_for_pop-up_2',''),(147,59,'_title_for_pop-up_2','field_62b570281175c'),(148,59,'description_for_pop-up_2',''),(149,59,'_description_for_pop-up_2','field_62b5706211761'),(150,59,'subtitle_2',''),(151,59,'_subtitle_2','field_62b57eb4e3371'),(152,59,'more_info_for_pop-up_2',''),(153,59,'_more_info_for_pop-up_2','field_62b570b77557d'),(154,59,'title_for_pop-up_3',''),(155,59,'_title_for_pop-up_3','field_62b5702b1175d'),(156,59,'description_for_pop-up_3',''),(157,59,'_description_for_pop-up_3','field_62b5706511762'),(158,59,'subtitle_3',''),(159,59,'_subtitle_3','field_62b57eb6e3372'),(160,59,'more_info_for_pop-up_3',''),(161,59,'_more_info_for_pop-up_3','field_62b570c37557e'),(162,59,'lilst_items_item_1',' “Public Safety Risk Assessment Clearinghouse,” Bureau of Justice Assistance, US Department of Justice, https://psrac.bja.ojp.gov/ '),(163,59,'_lilst_items_item_1','field_62b570ea75580'),(164,59,'lilst_items_item_2','“Use of Valid Actuarial Assessments of Risks and Needs,” National Parole Resource Center, https://nationalparoleresourcecenter.org/action-guide-use-of-valid-actuarial-assessments-of-risks-and-needs/selecting-and-validating-an-assessment-instrument.htm '),(165,59,'_lilst_items_item_2','field_62b570f575581'),(166,59,'lilst_items_item_3','Alex Chohlas-Wood, “Understanding risk assessment instruments in criminal justice,” https://www.brookings.edu/research/understanding-risk-assessment-instruments-in-criminal-justice/'),(167,59,'_lilst_items_item_3','field_62b570f675582'),(168,59,'lilst_items_item_4',''),(169,59,'_lilst_items_item_4','field_62b570f775583'),(170,59,'lilst_items',''),(171,59,'_lilst_items','field_62b570c97557f'),(172,60,'_wp_attached_file','2022/06/Illustration-1.png'),(173,60,'_wp_attachment_metadata','a:6:{s:5:\"width\";i:998;s:6:\"height\";i:1024;s:4:\"file\";s:26:\"2022/06/Illustration-1.png\";s:8:\"filesize\";i:1568351;s:5:\"sizes\";a:3:{s:6:\"medium\";a:5:{s:4:\"file\";s:26:\"Illustration-1-292x300.png\";s:5:\"width\";i:292;s:6:\"height\";i:300;s:9:\"mime-type\";s:9:\"image/png\";s:8:\"filesize\";i:124798;}s:9:\"thumbnail\";a:5:{s:4:\"file\";s:26:\"Illustration-1-150x150.png\";s:5:\"width\";i:150;s:6:\"height\";i:150;s:9:\"mime-type\";s:9:\"image/png\";s:8:\"filesize\";i:33294;}s:12:\"medium_large\";a:5:{s:4:\"file\";s:26:\"Illustration-1-768x788.png\";s:5:\"width\";i:768;s:6:\"height\";i:788;s:9:\"mime-type\";s:9:\"image/png\";s:8:\"filesize\";i:848431;}}s:10:\"image_meta\";a:12:{s:8:\"aperture\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"credit\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"camera\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"caption\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"created_timestamp\";s:1:\"0\";s:9:\"copyright\";s:0:\"\";s:12:\"focal_length\";s:1:\"0\";s:3:\"iso\";s:1:\"0\";s:13:\"shutter_speed\";s:1:\"0\";s:5:\"title\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"orientation\";s:1:\"0\";s:8:\"keywords\";a:0:{}}}'),(174,36,'_thumbnail_id','60'),(175,61,'_edit_last','1'),(176,61,'_edit_lock','1657029225:1'),(177,63,'_edit_last','1'),(178,63,'_edit_lock','1656935769:1'),(179,61,'about_title','Cop Out: Automation in the Criminal Legal System'),(180,61,'_about_title','field_62b59bd815102'),(181,61,'about_subtitle','Systems of policing and punishment in the U.S. are undergoing a major change: police, judges, prosecutors and other legal authorities are increasingly using algorithmic technologies when making decisions that have critical consequences in the lives of in dividuals and communities.'),(182,61,'_about_subtitle','field_62b59be315103'),(183,61,'bold_part_content_paragraph','Algorithms are ubiquitous in the criminal legal system.

They are also used to anticipate challenges incarcerated people will have during transitions into and out of institutionalization.\r\n\r\nWith “risk” in mind, criminal legal system officials make decisions about peoples’ liberty, supervision, and criminogenic needs. There are six main stages at which RATs are employed: pretrial, jail, prison, release, parole, and probation. Most notably, RATs are used for setting bail, case management in jails, sentencing, case management in prisons, informing discretionary release/parole, case management during parole, and determining probation.

Law enforcement purportedly uses face recognition to produce leads when trying to identify people in photos or video footage. There are generally two types of face recognition: one-to-one matching, which compares two photos to one another to verify they’re the same person; and one-to-many matching, which compares one photo to a large database in order to identify someone. In the latter, officers upload a “probe” photo of a face in question, and an algorithm analyzes its features, compares it to a database of face photos, and then issues a numerical score reflecting the similarity of the “probe” photo face to other faces in the database.\r\n\r\nWhen analyzing a photo, the algorithm first detects the presence of a face. Then, it “normalizes” the image, scaling and rotating so it’s in a standard position for comparison. Next, it extracts facial features like eyes and nose from the image. Finally, it compares these features to those in another photo, assigning a score based on how similar they are. Face recognition refers to this specific process, as distinct from other face analysis tools that purport to classify people’s faces by factors like gender or age.\r\n\r\n<strong>For more on the basics of crime forecasting, see:</strong>'),(507,42,'_more_info_for_pop-up_1','field_62b5709e7557c'),(508,42,'title_for_pop-up_2','Crime forecasting'),(509,42,'_title_for_pop-up_2','field_62b570281175c'),(510,42,'description_for_pop-up_2','You were designated as an “at-risk” individual by a crime forecasting algorithm, not necessarily as a perpetrator of crime, but potentially as a victim.

Law enforcement purportedly uses face recognition to produce leads when trying to identify people in photos or video footage. There are generally two types of face recognition: one-to-one matching, which compares two photos to one another to verify they’re the same person; and one-to-many matching, which compares one photo to a large database in order to identify someone. In the latter, officers upload a “probe” photo of a face in question, and an algorithm analyzes its features, compares it to a database of face photos, and then issues a numerical score reflecting the similarity of the “probe” photo face to other faces in the database. \r\n\r\nWhen analyzing a photo, the algorithm first detects the presence of a face. Then, it “normalizes” the image, scaling and rotating so it’s in a standard position for comparison. Next, it extracts facial features like eyes and nose from the image. Finally, it compares these features to those in another photo, assigning a score based on how similar they are. Face recognition refers to this specific process, as distinct from other face analysis tools that purport to classify people’s faces by factors like gender or age.\r\n\r\nFor more on the basics of face recognition technology, see:'),(559,90,'_more_info_for_pop-up_1','field_62b5709e7557c'),(560,90,'title_for_pop-up_2','Crime forecasting'),(561,90,'_title_for_pop-up_2','field_62b570281175c'),(562,90,'description_for_pop-up_2','You were designated as an “at-risk” individual by a crime forecasting algorithm, not necessarily as a perpetrator of crime, but potentially as a victim.

Judges must determine what kind of punishment or remedy is warranted, and, if incarcerated, the length of time.'),(666,92,'_more_info_for_pop-up_1','field_62b5709e7557c'),(667,92,'title_for_pop-up_2',''),(668,92,'_title_for_pop-up_2','field_62b570281175c'),(669,92,'description_for_pop-up_2',''),(670,92,'_description_for_pop-up_2','field_62b5706211761'),(671,92,'subtitle_2',''),(672,92,'_subtitle_2','field_62b57eb4e3371'),(673,92,'more_info_for_pop-up_2',''),(674,92,'_more_info_for_pop-up_2','field_62b570b77557d'),(675,92,'title_for_pop-up_3',''),(676,92,'_title_for_pop-up_3','field_62b5702b1175d'),(677,92,'description_for_pop-up_3',''),(678,92,'_description_for_pop-up_3','field_62b5706511762'),(679,92,'subtitle_3',''),(680,92,'_subtitle_3','field_62b57eb6e3372'),(681,92,'more_info_for_pop-up_3',''),(682,92,'_more_info_for_pop-up_3','field_62b570c37557e'),(683,92,'lilst_items_item_1',''),(684,92,'_lilst_items_item_1','field_62b570ea75580'),(685,92,'lilst_items_item_2',''),(686,92,'_lilst_items_item_2','field_62b570f575581'),(687,92,'lilst_items_item_3',''),(688,92,'_lilst_items_item_3','field_62b570f675582'),(689,92,'lilst_items_item_4',''),(690,92,'_lilst_items_item_4','field_62b570f775583'),(691,92,'lilst_items_item_5',''),(692,92,'_lilst_items_item_5','field_62b5a234d64c3'),(693,92,'lilst_items',''),(694,92,'_lilst_items','field_62b570c97557f'),(695,92,'lilst_items_2_item_1',''),(696,92,'_lilst_items_2_item_1','field_62b5a238d64c5'),(697,92,'lilst_items_2_item_2',''),(698,92,'_lilst_items_2_item_2','field_62b5a238d64c6'),(699,92,'lilst_items_2_item_3',''),(700,92,'_lilst_items_2_item_3','field_62b5a238d64c7'),(701,92,'lilst_items_2_item_4',''),(702,92,'_lilst_items_2_item_4','field_62b5a238d64c8'),(703,92,'lilst_items_2_item_5',''),(704,92,'_lilst_items_2_item_5','field_62b5a238d64c9'),(705,92,'lilst_items_2',''),(706,92,'_lilst_items_2','field_62b5a238d64c4'),(707,93,'_wp_attached_file','2022/06/Illustration-6..png'),(708,93,'_wp_attachment_metadata','a:6:{s:5:\"width\";i:998;s:6:\"height\";i:1024;s:4:\"file\";s:27:\"2022/06/Illustration-6..png\";s:8:\"filesize\";i:1836418;s:5:\"sizes\";a:3:{s:6:\"medium\";a:5:{s:4:\"file\";s:27:\"Illustration-6.-292x300.png\";s:5:\"width\";i:292;s:6:\"height\";i:300;s:9:\"mime-type\";s:9:\"image/png\";s:8:\"filesize\";i:148144;}s:9:\"thumbnail\";a:5:{s:4:\"file\";s:27:\"Illustration-6.-150x150.png\";s:5:\"width\";i:150;s:6:\"height\";i:150;s:9:\"mime-type\";s:9:\"image/png\";s:8:\"filesize\";i:40446;}s:12:\"medium_large\";a:5:{s:4:\"file\";s:27:\"Illustration-6.-768x788.png\";s:5:\"width\";i:768;s:6:\"height\";i:788;s:9:\"mime-type\";s:9:\"image/png\";s:8:\"filesize\";i:986925;}}s:10:\"image_meta\";a:12:{s:8:\"aperture\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"credit\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"camera\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"caption\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"created_timestamp\";s:1:\"0\";s:9:\"copyright\";s:0:\"\";s:12:\"focal_length\";s:1:\"0\";s:3:\"iso\";s:1:\"0\";s:13:\"shutter_speed\";s:1:\"0\";s:5:\"title\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"orientation\";s:1:\"0\";s:8:\"keywords\";a:0:{}}}'),(709,46,'_thumbnail_id','93'),(710,46,'title','Prison'),(711,46,'_title','field_62b56ffd11759'),(712,46,'text_in_left_part','<strong>You have been sentenced to prison time with the possibility of parole.</strong> While in prison, you are recommended for a job skills training and labor market reentry program, which you attend.'),(713,46,'_text_in_left_part','field_62b570091175a'),(714,46,'title_for_pop-up_1','Case management, planning, and supervision (prison)'),(715,46,'_title_for_pop-up_1','field_62b5701d1175b'),(716,46,'description_for_pop-up_1','A RAT tool has determined that because of your life circumstances, you are eligible for a job skills training and reentry program.'),(717,46,'_description_for_pop-up_1','field_62b570331175e'),(718,46,'subtitle_1','RAT: prison case management, planning, and supervision'),(719,46,'_subtitle_1','field_62b570927557b'),(720,46,'more_info_for_pop-up_1','Incarcerated individuals in prisons are subject to similar case management RATs as they are in jails.

Law enforcement sees these tools as more efficient and less biased than humans, capable of making quick decisions while also cutting costs. \r\n\r\n'),(2032,218,'_more_info_for_pop-up_2','field_62b570b77557d'),(2033,218,'title_for_pop-up_3','Case management, planning, and supervision (jail)'),(2034,218,'_title_for_pop-up_3','field_62b5702b1175d'),(2035,218,'description_for_pop-up_3','A RAT tool has considered you to be at a high risk for violence, so you are given maximum security while held in jail awaiting trial.'),(2036,218,'_description_for_pop-up_3','field_62b5706511762'),(2037,218,'subtitle_3','RAT: jail case management, planning, and supervision'),(2038,218,'_subtitle_3','field_62b57eb6e3372'),(2039,218,'more_info_for_pop-up_3','In jails, RATs are used to supplement case management, a process intended to reduce risk by ensuring individuals have access to needed resources.

Most commonly in the criminal legal system, they are used to forecast future misconduct; specifically, the chance an individual will skip bail, commit another crime, or be rearrested. They are also used to anticipate challenges incarcerated people will have during transitions into and out of institutionalization. \r\n\r\nWith “risk” in mind, criminal legal system officials make decisions about peoples’ liberty, supervision, and criminogenic needs. There are six main stages at which RATs are employed: pretrial, jail, prison, release, parole, and probation. Most notably, RATs are used for setting bail, case management in jails, sentencing, case management in prisons, informing discretionary release/parole, case management during parole, and determining probation. However, they can theoretically be used at any point during an individual’s interaction with the criminal legal system.\r\n\r\nFor more on the basics of risk assessment tools, see:'),(2092,219,'_more_info_for_pop-up_1','field_62b5709e7557c'),(2093,219,'title_for_pop-up_2','Bail (pretrial)'),(2094,219,'_title_for_pop-up_2','field_62b570281175c'),(2095,219,'description_for_pop-up_2','A RAT tool has considered you a flight risk, and thus you have been denied bail.'),(2096,219,'_description_for_pop-up_2','field_62b5706211761'),(2097,219,'subtitle_2','Risk assessment tools (RATs)'),(2098,219,'_subtitle_2','field_62b57eb4e3371'),(2099,219,'more_info_for_pop-up_2','A defendant often has their first encounter with an RAT before trial when their bail is being set. Here, RATs are used in one of two ways: to gauge the likelihood of an individual’s failure to appear (FTA) at their trial, or to assess their likelihood of committing another crime before trial. Historically, bail was used exclusively as a means to ensure court appearances and discourage flight. However, due to a number of political shifts, the concept of an individual’s “dangerousness” to the community became a major factor in bail determination. RATs, when used to set bail, now score people based on their FTA likelihood and risk of committing a crime after pretrial release.\r\n\r\nInitially, some critics of mass incarceration supported this application of RATs as a way to decrease pretrial detention rates and eliminate the disadvantage poor people face with cash bail. But these tools led to only small increases in pretrial release, and, in fact, increased FTAs and pretrial crime rates. Moreover, they yet again exhibit the limitations of data-driven technologies: because RATs are trained on specific data, they fail to reflect the true complex realities of the criminal legal system. Across place and time, RATs apply a one-size-fits-all approach to different contexts not necessarily compatible with the originally collected data. For example, RATs are often trained on older data; but if a jurisdiction has since instituted pretrial reforms, the RAT will reflect outdated practices rather than current ones. If a new diversion program is introduced to decrease pretrial detention and recidivism, the RAT does not take this into account, hiding any potential effects the reform has and reinforcing historical

Law enforcement purportedly uses face recognition to produce leads when trying to identify people in photos or video footage. There are generally two types of face recognition: one-to-one matching, which compares two photos to one another to verify they’re the same person; and one-to-many matching, which compares one photo to a large database in order to identify someone. In the latter, officers upload a “probe” photo of a face in question, and an algorithm analyzes its features, compares it to a database of face photos, and then issues a numerical score reflecting the similarity of the “probe” photo face to other faces in the database.\r\n\r\nWhen analyzing a photo, the algorithm first detects the presence of a face. Then, it “normalizes” the image, scaling and rotating so it’s in a standard position for comparison. Next, it extracts facial features like eyes and nose from the image. Finally, it compares these features to those in another photo, assigning a score based on how similar they are. Face recognition refers to this specific process, as distinct from other face analysis tools that purport to classify people’s faces by factors like gender or age.\r\n\r\n<strong>For more on the basics of crime forecasting, see:</strong>'),(2644,230,'_more_info_for_pop-up_1','field_62b5709e7557c'),(2645,230,'title_for_pop-up_2','Crime forecasting'),(2646,230,'_title_for_pop-up_2','field_62b570281175c'),(2647,230,'description_for_pop-up_2','You were designated as an “at-risk” individual by a crime forecasting algorithm, not necessarily as a perpetrator of crime, but potentially as a victim.

Law enforcement purportedly uses face recognition to produce leads when trying to identify people in photos or video footage. There are generally two types of face recognition: one-to-one matching, which compares two photos to one another to verify they’re the same person; and one-to-many matching, which compares one photo to a large database in order to identify someone. In the latter, officers upload a “probe” photo of a face in question, and an algorithm analyzes its features, compares it to a database of face photos, and then issues a numerical score reflecting the similarity of the “probe” photo face to other faces in the database.\r\n\r\nWhen analyzing a photo, the algorithm first detects the presence of a face. Then, it “normalizes” the image, scaling and rotating so it’s in a standard position for comparison. Next, it extracts facial features like eyes and nose from the image. Finally, it compares these features to those in another photo, assigning a score based on how similar they are. Face recognition refers to this specific process, as distinct from other face analysis tools that purport to classify people’s faces by factors like gender or age.\r\n\r\n<strong>For more on the basics of crime forecasting, see:</strong>'),(2704,231,'_more_info_for_pop-up_1','field_62b5709e7557c'),(2705,231,'title_for_pop-up_2','Crime forecasting'),(2706,231,'_title_for_pop-up_2','field_62b570281175c'),(2707,231,'description_for_pop-up_2','You were designated as an “at-risk” individual by a crime forecasting algorithm, not necessarily as a perpetrator of crime, but potentially as a victim.

Most commonly in the criminal legal system, they are used to forecast future misconduct; specifically, the chance an individual will skip bail, commit another crime, or be rearrested. They are also used to anticipate challenges incarcerated people will have during transitions into and out of institutionalization.\r\n\r\nWith “risk” in mind, criminal legal system officials make decisions about peoples’ liberty, supervision, and criminogenic needs.

If a new diversion program is introduced to decrease pretrial detention and recidivism, the RAT does not take this into account, hiding any potential effects the reform has and reinforcing historical trends.'),(3164,253,'_more_info_for_pop-up_2','field_62b570b77557d'),(3165,253,'title_for_pop-up_3',''),(3166,253,'_title_for_pop-up_3','field_62b5702b1175d'),(3167,253,'description_for_pop-up_3',''),(3168,253,'_description_for_pop-up_3','field_62b5706511762'),(3169,253,'subtitle_3',''),(3170,253,'_subtitle_3','field_62b57eb6e3372'),(3171,253,'more_info_for_pop-up_3',''),(3172,253,'_more_info_for_pop-up_3','field_62b570c37557e'),(3173,253,'lilst_items_item_1','“Public Safety Risk Assessment Clearinghouse,” Bureau of Justice Assistance, US Department of Justice, https://psrac.bja.ojp.gov/ '),(3174,253,'_lilst_items_item_1','field_62b570ea75580'),(3175,253,'lilst_items_item_2','“Use of Valid Actuarial Assessments of Risks and Needs,” National Parole Resource Center, https://nationalparoleresourcecenter.org/action-guide-use-of-valid-actuarial-assessments-of-risks-and-needs/selecting-and-validating-an-assessment-instrument.htm '),(3176,253,'_lilst_items_item_2','field_62b570f575581'),(3177,253,'lilst_items_item_3','Alex Chohlas-Wood, “Understanding risk assessment instruments in criminal justice,” https://www.brookings.edu/research/understanding-risk-assessment-instruments-in-criminal-justice/'),(3178,253,'_lilst_items_item_3','field_62b570f675582'),(3179,253,'lilst_items_item_4',''),(3180,253,'_lilst_items_item_4','field_62b570f775583'),(3181,253,'lilst_items_item_5',''),(3182,253,'_lilst_items_item_5','field_62b5a234d64c3'),(3183,253,'lilst_items',''),(3184,253,'_lilst_items','field_62b570c97557f'),(3185,253,'lilst_items_2_item_1',''),(3186,253,'_lilst_items_2_item_1','field_62b5a238d64c5'),(3187,253,'lilst_items_2_item_2',''),(3188,253,'_lilst_items_2_item_2','field_62b5a238d64c6'),(3189,253,'lilst_items_2_item_3',''),(3190,253,'_lilst_items_2_item_3','field_62b5a238d64c7'),(3191,253,'lilst_items_2_item_4',''),(3192,253,'_lilst_items_2_item_4','field_62b5a238d64c8'),(3193,253,'lilst_items_2_item_5',''),(3194,253,'_lilst_items_2_item_5','field_62b5a238d64c9'),(3195,253,'lilst_items_2',''),(3196,253,'_lilst_items_2','field_62b5a238d64c4'),(3197,253,'paper_file_title',''),(3198,253,'_paper_file_title','field_62b962bd14753'),(3199,253,'paper_file',''),(3200,253,'_paper_file','field_62b5cb0fefce1'),(3201,253,'app_file_title',''),(3202,253,'_app_file_title','field_62b96421bf4ca'),(3203,253,'app_file',''),(3204,253,'_app_file','field_62b5cb1eefce2'),(3205,183,'_thumbnail_id','177'),(3206,256,'title','Parole'),(3207,256,'_title','field_62b56ffd11759'),(3208,256,'text_in_left_part','<strong>Once you have been released back into the community on parole, you are still under supervision of a parole officer.</strong> According to your parole officer, you are considered at risk for drug use, and are required to attend anti-drug use courses as well as submit urine samples every week.
